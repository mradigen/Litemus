Change Type: MAJOR

Summary

-> Massive Code refactor (not done yet but progress made)

-> Implemented lyrics view in window 3 (with scrolling options)

-> Code is still a bit cluttered (maybe a few redundancies are present too) but most are noted or taken care of

-> Updated lmus_cache.cpp to also parse the release date and year of a song as well (for future implementation)

-> Moving a step closer toward a better and more efficient TUI and UX with functional changes to window management
