Change type: MEDIUM

Summary

-> lmus_cache process is now within a clean TUI with a progress bar and time remaining (time remaining is not perfect but it will do for now)

-> Tried to remove the while loop for lyrics_win to scroll but didnt work (will try and itemize each line in a duplicate of artistMenu and display it to avoid any loops)

-> Updated a few functions to make code more modular

-> Renamed main cpp file to litemus.cpp

-> Added mute function

-> Updated lyrics win to have song name and its artist for better UX

-> The lyrics_win while loop now has play/pause and +- vol control (aim is if we cannot remove this loop, only player vol control is accessible when in lyrics view)

-> Fixed some flickering issues when in lyrics view
