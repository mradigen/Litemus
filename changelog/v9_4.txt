Change type: MAJOR

Summary

-> Integration of more audio formats done (.wav, .flac integrated for now)

-> Lmus cache metadata extraction issues resolved

-> debug.log file created with efficient showcase of all fields of metadata extraction

-> Toggling of help window and session details window now is cleaner (focus toggles to songMenu), and pressing 1 focuses back to artistMenu with all artists

-> Changing the title of the artists window to help window when switching to help win and session details

-> Added a `build.sh` script that creates the `build/` directory, builds it, and finally addes the `lmus` alias to the respective shell rc
