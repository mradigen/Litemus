Change Type: MAJOR

Summary

-> Added a second window to proceed with the cmus like ncurses environement (artists - left win, songs of artist - right win)

-> Massive change to lmus_cache method ::

1. Instead of creating directories based on metadata, it is all compressed into one song_names.json that is easily parsable

2. Bugfixes in the cache and song sort method (now the songs in each artist subcategory are sorted by album,disc and track)

3. Refer to working.md to understand the new directory caching method

-> Cleanup of a lot of code (further cleanup needed though)

-> Easy access of both windows and all functionality is intact
